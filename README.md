Hello,

I don't even know where to begin with this reflection. Every week it feels like I'm raking over a disaster area. Obviously I have been given an extension, and even with that I haven't been able to complete what I would have liked and it all feels like a right mess so I'm struggling to see any positives.

I have really wanted to have a go at completing the set Interval as well as the fetching and rendering of the upgrade data. I had a real issue with the fetching of the data and the useEffect feature in React. I couldn't for the life of me work out what the bug.

I also see that when I have an issue with the functionality side of things, I then can't see the website locally because of the bug so this then presents a problem with the styling.

So I haven't done any of that and the development isn't rendered. This is annoying as I was hoping to get some media queries in which I had managed to do on the group project successfuly. I was also hoping to get some wacky 70's colour palletes going on.

I am still struggling to understand everything that is presented each week, even on a seemingly basic level. I clearly need some help with the way I am connecting the various blocks of code. I'm just not there yet I'm afraid.
